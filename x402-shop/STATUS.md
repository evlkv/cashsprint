These paths were not in the live catalog (`ping` … `ns`, plus live extras `offer-proof`, `commerce-page-audit`, `commerce-schema-fix`, `feed-page-match`, `feed-batch-match`, `merchant-feed-audit`), or undeployed batches `1.5.0`–`1.41.0` (`whois` … `unclecount`). `/pay/https` was skipped because `/pay/svcb` already returns HTTPS DNS records. `/pay/a` was skipped because `/pay/dns` already returns A records. `/pay/gaslimit` was skipped because `/pay/gasused` already returns `gasLimit`. `/pay/receipt` was skipped because `/pay/txid` already returns receipt status. `/pay/parent` was skipped because `/pay/blockhash` already returns `parentHash`. `/pay/miner` was skipped because `/pay/coinbase` already returns the block miner. `/pay/withdrawalsroot` was skipped because `/pay/withdrawals` already returns `withdrawalsRoot`. `/pay/sha3uncles` was skipped because `/pay/uncles` already returns `sha3Uncles`. `/pay/timestamp` was skipped because `/pay/block` already returns `timestamp`. `/pay/totaldifficulty` was skipped because `/pay/difficulty` already returns `totalDifficulty`. `/pay/dnt-policy` was skipped because `/pay/dnt` already fetches `/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt`. `/pay/host-meta-json` was skipped because `/pay/host-meta` already fetches `host-meta.json`. `/pay/did-json` was skipped because `/pay/did` already fetches `did.json`. `/pay/bytecode` was skipped because `/pay/code` already returns `eth_getCode`.
