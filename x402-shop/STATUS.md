## New paid GET routes this batch

| Path | Price | Query | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/pay/dnscert` | $0.002 | `host` | DNS CERT (RFC 4398) records (not TLS `/pay/cert`) |
| `/pay/avc` | $0.002 | `host` | DNS AVC (Application Visibility and Control) |
| `/pay/nsap` | $0.002 | `host` | DNS NSAP address records |
| `/pay/change-password` | $0.002 | `host` | `/.well-known/change-password` Location |
| `/pay/web-identity` | $0.002 | `host` | FedCM `/.well-known/web-identity` |
| `/pay/extradata` | $0.001 | — | Base latest block `extraData` |

These paths were not in the live `1.4.0` catalog (`ping` … `ns`), or undeployed batches `1.5.0`–`1.26.0` (`whois` … `logsbloom`). `/pay/https` was skipped because `/pay/svcb` already returns HTTPS DNS records. `/pay/gaslimit` was skipped because `/pay/gasused` already returns `gasLimit`. `/pay/receipt` was skipped because `/pay/txid` already returns receipt status. `/pay/parent` was skipped because `/pay/blockhash` already returns `parentHash`. Client landing files were not changed.

## Deploy / register

- Target: VPS `/opt/x402-shop` via rsync, then `systemctl restart x402-shop`
- Re-register: `public.resources.registerFromOrigin` for the origin above
- 2026-08-19 02:05 UTC run: `bun test` in `x402-shop/` is 6/6 pass. Live origin still serves catalog `1.4.0`; unpaid `GET /pay/ping` is 402 (`x402Version` 2, `scheme` exact, `network` `eip155:8453`, amount `1000`, extra name `USD Coin` version `2`). Unpaid `GET /pay/dnscert` is 404 until VPS deploy. SSH to `root@volkov.evgeny.m2.fvds.ru` and `ubuntu@volkov.evgeny.m2.fvds.ru` is `Permission denied (publickey,password)` because this environment has no `VPS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`. Requested `VPS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` (optional `VPS_SSH_USER`, `VPS_SSH_HOST`) via environment setup actions.
- x402scan `registerFromOrigin`: success, originId `b2e86a98-1ff4-449d-a288-4cf445a20a4c`, source OpenAPI, 28/28 registered, 0 failed, 0 deprecated. New 1.27.0 paths will index after VPS deploy + another register.
